## 🏆 Summary  
I am a passionate developer with a startup approach to my craft. I possess strong soft skills, allowing me to pitch products to investors and secure funding, as I did for my first startup. While I have experience in management, I prefer hands-on roles where I can write innovative and modern code—my true passion.
